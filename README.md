# My climbing drills (name is subject to change...)

### An open source social climbing training app

## Features

* Create your own training schedule and your own exercises with the available widgets
* Or, start from another user's template, or an available trainer's template
* Share your new template with the community
* Vote on other users training plans and exercises
* Log your trainings and see your progess over time
* Dynamic calendar with drag and drop features to move your training days and exercises around
* Build a profile and exchange with other passionate rock climbers

Note: it's mostly a personal project of mine to practice a lot of developing skills I acquired in the past 2 years. But, if anybody's eventually interested in participating or see potential in that app, please contact me.
